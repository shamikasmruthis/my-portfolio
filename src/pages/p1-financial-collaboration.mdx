## Problem

Financial management in households is inherently collaborative, yet digital financial systems are designed for individual use. Existing research focuses on Western contexts or low-income households in India, leaving the collaborative practices of digitally-active households understudied. Current systems offer only rigid solutions like joint accounts, failing to accommodate the fluid, negotiated nature of household financial collaboration.

## Goals

- Document collaborative financial practices across diverse Indian household structures
- Identify gaps between user needs and current digital financial system capabilities
- Formulate design principles to enable support and collaboration in financial digital applications

## Methods

diary studies → follow-up interviews → analysis → co-design workshops → analysis → design recommendations

### Phase 1: Diary Studies

I recruited 11 women across India who actively manage household finances, from three-generation homes to young professionals living with parents to couples managing money together.

Participants captured moments of financial collaboration over one week—planning expenses, paying bills, negotiating budgets, or thinking "I should tell my partner about this purchase." They chose their format (Excel, WhatsApp, or forms) to make logging feel natural.

I collected 101 entries spanning quick grocery decisions to long-term investment planning. Daily check-ins sustained engagement. After each week, I conducted 45-minute interviews to understand not just what happened, but why households operate this way.

Thematic analysis in NVivo revealed five patterns around responsibility division, tool preferences, and the tracking challenges households face.

### Phase 2: Co-Design Workshops

I ran three remote workshops (3 participants each) exploring "How might we build financial awareness so everyone feels involved and informed?"

In the first activity, groups discussed four real scenarios from the diary studies. What should the "budget system" say, think, do, and feel? Scenarios addressed visibility gaps, accountability needs, and technical comfort levels.

In the second activity, participants individually visualized their ideal system using images and notes on FigJam boards.

Analysis mapped their ideas across financial management stages (Plan, Act, Track, Analyze, Adjust) and the spectrum of human control versus system automation. Participants wanted tools that support their decisions without removing agency.

## Findings

### Cultural Insight: "It's My Money But It's Our Money"

Indian families operate with shared financial consciousness despite individual bank accounts. Family members know each other's passwords, share cards, and pool resources without strict settlement practices.

### Key Collaborative Behaviors

**Fluid responsibility:** Tasks assigned by tech-savviness and convenience, not rigid rules

**Care work by women:** Mothers typically manage household expenses across generations

**Knowledge sharing:** Parents guide children; families leverage each other's financial instruments for optimal benefits

**Negotiated spending:** Communication before large purchases; collective compromise and prioritization

### System Mismatches

**Lack of awareness:** Scattered systems create incomplete household financial pictures

**Inaccessibility:** Steep learning curves exclude less tech-savvy members

**Tracking burden:** Manual logging feels cumbersome; existing bank data poorly categorized

### Workshop Insights

Participants mapped needs across financial stages, requesting automation while maintaining control. Key desires: system as "co-planner" for goals, just-in-time budget alerts, auto-tracking with flexible inputs, graphical analysis with abstracted sharing, and intelligent adjustment suggestions with final user say.

## Recommendations

### 1. Support Collaborative Visibility Without Enforcing Transparency

- Configurable broadcasts letting members decide which updates to share
- Periodic household spending summaries surfacing patterns
- Abstract information sharing (categorical spending vs. itemized transactions)

### 2. Design for Universal Accessibility

- Multiple format presentation (graphical + textual) with progressive disclosure
- Platform flexibility integrating with familiar channels (WhatsApp notifications, cross-device widgets)
- Simple and advanced views accommodating different comfort levels

### 3. Reduce Manual Effort by Leveraging Existing Data

- Allow appropriation of banking apps (custom categories, budget alerts)
- Support "good enough" methods (rough budget limits, general awareness)
- Social tracking features (tagging who paid) enabling lightweight accountability

**Core philosophy:** Adapt existing systems to fit collaborative practices rather than forcing households to adopt entirely new tools.

## Reflection

Participants didn't perceive individualized banking as frustrating—they'd built collaborative workarounds around rigid systems. The real issue isn't user dissatisfaction but systemic invisibility of household practices in financial design. This suggests the solution isn't reinventing banking but making existing tools appropriable for collaboration.

### Future Directions

AI-enabled financial collaboration holds promise but requires careful exploration of consent, trust, and household autonomy. How might AI act as a "fifth household member"—a co-planner that assists without controlling? What safeguards prevent harmful advice for vulnerable users?
