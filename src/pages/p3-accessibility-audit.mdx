# Accessibility audit for the RBO

## Brief

The Royal Ballet and Opera website wanted an accessibility audit of their 'about' and 'visitor information' pages. 

## Goals

1. Evaluate the website's accessibility compliance against WCAG 2.2 Guidelines (up to Level AA conformance)
2. Evaluate with assistive technology (Screenreaders and text-to-speech)
3. Manually test against best web practices for disabled and neurodivergent users.

Identify criteria to prioritize top 10 severe accessibility issues that need remediation.

## Process

</div>

### Phase 1 (Understanding requirements)
- Familiarized with UK government user profiles and WCAG 2.2 guidelines
- Adopted WCAG-EM methodology
- Performed initial website sweep of homepage and visitor information page

### Phase 2 (Testing)
- **Automated testing:** WAVE evaluation tool, WebAIM's contrast checker, Luma (for video flashes)
- **Manual testing:** Cross-checking against WCAG 2.2 Guidelines
- **Testing with assistive technology:** VoiceOver (Mac screenreader), Chrome Developer tools

### Phase 3 (Reporting)
- Shortlisted 10 most severe issues with severity ratings based on number of users affected and how widespread the issue was
- Provided solutions and next steps to the RBO

## Findings

Problems were clustered under these overarching issues:

<section class="issues">
  <div class="issue">
    <div class="issue-text">
      <h3>Page structure issues</h3>
      <p>Both pages had missing or empty headings that left gaps in the content hierarchy. They lacked semantic HTML markup to distinguish between headers, navigation, main content, and footers, making it difficult for assistive technology users to understand how the page was organized.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="issue-image">
      <img src="/images/accessibility/headings.webp" alt="Example of incorrect page structure" />
      <p class="caption">Example of missing headings</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="issue reverse">
    <div class="issue-text">
      <h3>Navigation challenges</h3>
      <p>The hamburger menu at 150% zoom was inaccessible via keyboard (skipped in tab order and created keyboard traps when forcefully accessed). There was no "skip to main content" link for users to bypass repetitive navigation, and redundant links (where images and adjacent buttons led to the same destination) created confusion about page relationships.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="issue-image">
      <img src="/images/accessibility/keyboard-trap.webp" alt="Image demonstrates keyboard trap issue at 150% zoom with an arrow pointing at a highlighted link and says: Links outside of menu being focused but user is caught in keyboard trap" />
      <p class="caption">Keyboard trap at 150% zoom</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="issue">
    <div class="issue-text">
      <h3>Inaccessible content and media</h3>
      <p>Alt text was either too lengthy or redundant in many places. Search bars lacked form labels and icons lacked alt text. Videos had no captions or audio descriptions for users with hearing or visual impairments. The site lost critical functionality (search and basket icons disappeared) when text spacing was adjusted for readability.  The page language attribute was undefined which could confuse screen readers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="issue-image">
      <img src="/images/accessibility/inaccessible-content.webp" alt="Images is a compilation of three screenshots from WAVE accessibility checker that detected multiple instances of redundant and lengthy alt text" />
      <p class="caption">Redundant and lengthy alt text detected by WAVE</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>


10 issues were identified ranging from high to low severity, affecting users with visual, mobility, cognitive, and auditory impairments.

## Recommendations

### Immediate technical fixes for critical barriers:

**Page structure:**
- Add proper heading hierarchy
- Implement semantic HTML tags (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`)
- Create a "skip to main content" link

**Keyboard navigation:**
- Make the hamburger menu accessible via tab order (tabindex="0")
- Add escape mechanisms to prevent keyboard traps
- Ensure all interactive elements are reachable

**Content accessibility:**
- Add form labels to search bars
- Provide descriptive alt text for icons and images
- Include captions and transcripts for all videos
- Use relative measurements so the site remains functional when users adjust text spacing

### Strategic recommendations for long-term accessibility:

**Reduce cognitive load:** Implement breadcrumbs and signposting for wayfinding, maintain consistent visual design patterns (based on W3C Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Task Force guidelines)

**Champion responsive design:** Ensure the site works across all zoom levels and text format adjustments

**Build capacity:** Provide developer training on writing accessible code from the start

**Move beyond checklists:** Test early and often with actual users with disabilities, as not all accessibility issues appear in automated tools or guidelines

## Reflection

I would give more thought to how I prioritize accessibility issues in future audits. The RBO was already quite compliant and the issues I found were major ones.

Moving forward, I would:
- Develop clearer criteria for prioritization that balances user needs and business needs
- Consider multiple factors: number of users impacted, severity of impact, how widespread the issue is across the site, whether it's a design pattern requiring systemic fixes
- Collect actual data from users and their feedback rather than relying solely on guidelines and my assessment

This would make the audit more actionable and help stakeholders understand not just what needs fixing, but why certain issues should be addressed first based on real user impact data.
