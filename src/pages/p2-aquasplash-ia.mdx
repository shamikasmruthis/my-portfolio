## Problem

The water adventure sports domain is vast, broad, and deeply information-rich, making it challenging to organize content in a way that serves diverse users—from certified adventure enthusiasts to complete beginners—who have different priorities when searching for activities (some prioritize destination, others prioritize sport type).

## Goals

To design a clear, navigable information architecture for a complex, information-rich domain (water adventure sports) that would help users easily find and book appropriate courses and activities based on their preferred search approach (by destination, sport type, or skill level).

## Research & Modeling

Interviewed four water sports experts (certified enthusiast, academy owner, trainer, trip organizer) to map the domain's information landscape and identify key concepts that became initial content labels. Created a domain model highlighting entity relationships and importance hierarchies.

## Information Architecture

### Card sorting

**Open card sort** with 6 participants (4 moderated, 2 unmoderated) revealed initial labels ('experiences', 'courses', 'certifications', 'academies') were confusing and overlapping. Renamed to 'activities' and 'courses' for clarity.

**Closed card sort** with 4 participants validated renamed labels and tested a new 'Become a Trainer' heading; 3 of 4 correctly placed certification labels under it.

### Tree testing

Tree testing with 8 participants validated navigation paths but revealed pogo-sticking: 4 of 8 users bounced between 'destinations' and 'activities' when searching for location-specific activities. Retained headings to test search approaches of diverse users (planners/spontaneous travelers).

### Sitemap

Developed final sitemap incorporating findings—a moderate flat hierarchy with refined labels and multiple navigation paths.

    <p className="caption">Sitemap</p>
  </div>

## Design

Created user journey mapping the task flow for finding courses through different entry points (browsing by destination vs. sport vs. skill level).

Designed four wireframes visualizing key pages: homepage, destination/course results page with interactive map, course information page, and bookings page.

## Evaluation

Moderated wireframe testing with 3 participants (water sports enthusiast, backpacker, newcomer) using tasks tailored to their profiles. Tested navigation ease, element clarity, and findability through open-ended scenarios.

### Findings

- All 3 users chose destination-first navigation over sport-first, validating its prominence despite tree test concerns: *"Well, surfing is the same everywhere, so wouldn't you want to check out the vibes of the destination?"*
- Users found text-heavy sections overwhelming and wanted control over information density
- Map interaction was unclear—users couldn't distinguish between selected regions and potential routes
- Labeling was clear and navigation intuitive overall

### Iteration

- Maintained destination-first navigation in header despite pogo-sticking, as evaluation confirmed user preference
- Converted lengthy "What to Expect" sections into expandable dropdown menus, giving users control over information display
- Added "Selected region: [location]" label to map as a visual signifier clarifying interaction state

## Reflection

This project taught me that testing context matters. Even though tree testing flagged pogo-sticking as problematic, wireframe evaluation revealed users actually preferred destination-first navigation despite extra clicks. In future work, I'd prototype multiple navigation models earlier to compare efficiency against preference through A/B testing. 

Most importantly, I learned that fixing every usability issue isn't always right; sometimes user preference trumps efficiency, and recognizing when to accept that tradeoff requires contextual testing beyond checklists.
