# About me

I'm Shamika, a UX designer and HCI researcher based in London, UK. I specialize in a variety of user research methods to create digital experiences with ethics, accessibility, and sustainability in mind.

## My approach

I believe good design should serve both people and planet. My work focuses on understanding user needs through research, creating inclusive interfaces that work for everyone, and building systems that are mindful of their environmental impact.

## Background

With a background in Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction, I combine user research, interaction design, and accessibility expertise to solve complex design challenges. I'm also no stranger to code and AI. This website is proof!

## Let's connect
