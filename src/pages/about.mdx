# About me

I'm Shamika, a UX designer and HCI researcher based in Manchester, UK. I specialize in creating digital experiences that are ethical, accessible, and sustainable.

## My approach

I believe good design should serve both people and planet. My work focuses on understanding user needs through research, creating inclusive interfaces that work for everyone, and building systems that are mindful of their environmental impact.

## Background

With a background in Human-Computer Interaction, I combine user research, interaction design, and accessibility expertise to solve complex design challenges. I'm particularly interested in information architecture, inclusive design practices, and designing for behavioral change.

## What I do

- User research and usability testing
- Information architecture and content strategy
- Accessibility audits and WCAG compliance
- Interaction design and prototyping
- Design systems and pattern libraries

## Let's connect
