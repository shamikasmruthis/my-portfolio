# Colophon

## Design & Development

This website was designed and built by Shamika Sriram in 2025. It's built with Astro and deployed on Netlify.

## Typography

The site uses Figtree, a sans-serif typeface designed by Erik Kennedy. Type scaling is fluid and responsive using Utopia.

## Accessibility

I'm working on making the website accessible. Every decision with respect to layouts and images have been made with accessibility in mind. If you encounter any barriers, please let me know.

## Sustainability

This website is designed with sustainability in mind:
- The absolute bare minimum JavaScript
- Efficient fonts
- compressed images in webp format
- Static site generation using Astro for reduced server load
- Green hosting through [hosting provider]

## Color Palette

- Background: #FEFCE8
- Primary text: #713F12
- Secondary: #92400E

The color palette is an ode to my favorite dessert--tiramisu.
